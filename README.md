### Task

* Write a function that given an ISO date string, returns the week of the year in timezone "Europe/Berlin"
* must respect ISO 8601 Week
* no time libraries, only java.*
* can use: malli.*, clojure.test*, hyperfiddle.rcf
* expected output / evaluation criteria:
   - the steps you took to solve it (best to write them down as you do it) / there's no wrongs IMO, it's more about the journey
   - tests / which kind of tests you wrote, how did you come up with the cases
   - the function itself / style
* the whole thing can be a code snippet as long as the dependencies, require and imports are provided
* the steps can be provided separatly
* function and tests should be written and commented as you would in production code**
